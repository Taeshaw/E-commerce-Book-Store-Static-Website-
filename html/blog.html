                <h3>The best history of April</h3>
                <h5>Chris Schluep | April 4, 2022</h5>
                <p>All of the novels in April's finest history have a common theme. Typically, the monthly list 
                    contains a few titles that are less historically significant and more obscure. For example, I'm
                     thinking of a book about the history of the mosquito (which, by the way, is a significant, though 
                     not immediately evident, history). However, the novels this month are all highly historical. 
                     Is that what it feels like to feel like you're seeing history unfold on your television, newspaper, 
                     or phone every night? Maybe

                <h3>Celebrating Transgender Day of Visibility</h3>
                <h5>Vannessa Cronin | March 30, 2022</h5>
                <p>On March 31, the globe commemorates Transgender Day of Visibility. The goal of the day is to highlight
                     and celebrate the transgender community's fortitude and successes in the face of hardship. Here are
                      a few works we think can help you achieve exactly that, from a breakthrough and best-selling trans 
                      memoir published in 2003 that is still taught in queer studies schools to a soon-to-be-released 
                      collection of essays that celebrate the delight of trans individuals feeling "radiantly themselves."

                <h3>Our favorite Easter books for kids</h3>
                <h5>Seira Wilson | March 30, 2022</h5>
                <p>Easter is approaching, which means it's time for cute children's books featuring chicks, bunnies, and 
                    plenty of fun. These 11 titles, some of which are tried and true and others which are fresh new, are 
                    ideal for the days leading up to Easter or for include in an Easter basket.

                <h3>Book by Book: Lisa Scottoline</h3>
                <h5>Vannessa Cronin | March 29, 2022</h5>
                <p>
                    Lisa Scottoline understands how to keep her readers on the edge of their seats. In her latest novel, 
                    What Happened to the Bennetts, an ordinary suburban family is victimized by a horrific carjacking, 
                    sending them on a harrowing journey they never imagined. The emotional interest in the characters, 
                    like in all of Scottoline's works, is what makes the story so high-stakes for readers. She creates 
                    people that readers feel as if they know as if they are members of their own family. We were looking 
                    forward to going through Scottoline's books one by one (the cute dog pic was the cherry on the sundae).

                <h3>Books we’re talking about</h3>
                <h5>Al Woodworth | March 29, 2022</h5>
                <p>This week, we’re talking about a lot of different books. In one corner, the conversation is circling around
                     the Oscars and the controversy surrounding Will Smith. In the other, we’re talking about the late, great,
                      Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright; Hilary Mantel’s work; a book that inspired a Netflix show; a novel
                       to celebrate International Transgender Visibility Day, and more. As always, there’s so much to talk about.

                <h3>Read ‘em and weep</h3>
                <h5>Al Woodworth | March 24, 2022</h5>
                <p>I've previously admitted to having a weakness for books that make me weep. And I'm sure others do as well: 
                    who doesn't want to be emotionally invested in the novel they're reading or the characters they're inhabiting? 
                    So, here's a list of books that will make you feel everything—fiction and nonfiction, old and fresh. Rest 
                    assured that, while they may make you cry, they also confirm humanity's power and may even make you grin. 
                    (And if you enjoy the bittersweet—that is, absorbing both the good and the bad—mark your calendars for Susan 
                    Cain's new nonfiction book, Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole, which will be released on April 5.)
