                <p>
                    Because most professionals are extremely active on this website, 
                    I visited it in order to clear up certain doubts regarding certain themes. 
                    This webpage was quite useful in understanding what a given tag or property 
                    performs in the creation of a website. Knowing that the majority of the 
                    specialists were present to answer my questions and assist me with my project
                     gave me the confidence to make this website as appealing as possible.

                    <h2>Toptal</h2>
                    <p>
                        I discovered that we could use icons previously developed ../images, which 
                        was the website toptal, after watching a video on YouTube. We can copy an 
                        html copy in a format (i.e. #$ %2314) from this website, which we can 
                        utilize in our html to show on the webpage we're developing. In the page 
                        part at the bottom, I utilized an arrow icon to make the page easily 
                        understood to anybody who uses it.

                    <p>
                        This is another website I discovered when looking for techniques on YouTube.
                         Not much of a difference creating thing from this website, but I used the 
                         color codes for different areas of my webpage and made every division (div) 
                         of the webpage different in color and even the texts different when you hover 
                         over them against the standard ones.

                        During the creation of this website, the above website was viewed the majority 
                        of the time. It is an instructional website that disseminates ideas and teaches 
                        the syntax for writing code. It offers information on nearly all student courses, 
                        such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, SQL, and so on. I came to this website to 
                        clear up my worries about the project because of its simplicity in showing how to 
                        write code and its quick and brief thorough explanations on every connected issue.

                    This webpage that I followed did assist me in avoiding debugging when developing a website.
                     Despite the fact that I had visited other websites in search of a solution to my problem, 
                     this was the most effective approach to learn from my mistakes and repair them with the 
                     greatest outcomes. While working on this project, a simple explanation on how to use 
                     tags from specialists was quite helpful. Below is a list of video links that may be used 
                     as a reference for my website.
